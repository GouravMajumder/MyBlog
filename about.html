                Hi!.. I'm Gourav Majumder. An ECE(UG) student at Academy of Technology, currently in 3rd sem. 
                This is my first blog website. I will try to gather information and provide you interesting contents to read. 
                But why through a blog right??. Here is the answer. 
                One of the advantages of blogs is that it allows you to build and to control your online identity. 
                Aside reading from online blogs you can create your own blogs, social network profiles, people who are searching for your name can find your blog or your author page on other blogs. 
                That information will help people to get to know you better by reading your work.
